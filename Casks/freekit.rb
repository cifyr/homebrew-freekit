# Homebrew cask for FreeKit. Lives in the tap repo cifyr/homebrew-freekit
# (path Casks/freekit.rb). See HOMEBREW.md for the release + tap workflow.
#
# The app is signed with a self-signed identity, NOT notarized, so a normal
# `brew install --cask freekit` would quarantine it and Gatekeeper would block
# first launch. Until the app is notarized, install with:
#   brew install --cask --no-quarantine freekit
